# Mistral Agents

**Mistral Le Chat agent prompts and Mistral Vibe skills for WordPress development.**

This repository holds two kinds of reusable AI instructions:

- **Le Chat agents** — system prompts you paste into a [Mistral Le Chat](https://chat.mistral.ai) agent to get consistent output for a specific role, such as building a WordPress page section or reviewing its HTML/CSS.
- **Vibe skills** — [Agent Skills](https://docs.mistral.ai/vibe/code/cli/skills) for [Mistral Vibe](https://docs.mistral.ai/vibe/) that run inside your project, read its files, run git and linters, and report — such as `/code-review`.

Imagewize created these for its own WordPress work — the Elayne block theme, the Nynaeve Sage theme and the Aludra block plugin — but they are written to adapt to other projects. Use as-is, extend, or fork.

## 💬 Le Chat Agents

### Quick Start

1. Copy any `.md` file from the `agents/` directory (e.g., `agents/FRONTEND-DEV.md`)
2. Paste into Le Chat → **Agents** → New Agent → **System Prompt**
3. Set model to `mistral-large-latest` or `devstral`
4. Start chatting!

> **Tip**: All prompts follow a consistent structure — you can easily modify them for your tech stack.

### Available Agents

| Agent | Role | Focus | Best For |
|-------|------|-------|----------|
| [FRONTEND-DEV.md](/agents/FRONTEND-DEV.md) | Senior Frontend Developer | WordPress themes, HTML/CSS, block patterns | WordPress devs, theme authors |
| [REVIEWER.md](/agents/REVIEWER.md) | Frontend Code Reviewer | HTML/CSS output analysis, FSE compliance | Frontend devs, designers |

**Planned Agents:**
- `BACKEND-DEV.md` - PHP/WordPress & general backend development
- `DEVOPS.md` - Deployment, infrastructure, and CI/CD
- `CONTENT-STRATEGY.md` - Content planning and SEO
- `UI-UX.md` - User interface and experience design
- `QA-TESTING.md` - Quality assurance and testing strategies
- `ACCESSIBILITY.md` - WCAG compliance and a11y best practices

### WordPress Context

The current agents are tailored for these Imagewize projects:

| Project | Type | Tech Stack |
|---------|------|------------|
| **Elayne** | FSE Block Theme | Gutenberg, theme.json, patterns |
| **Nynaeve** | Sage 11 Hybrid | Blade, ACF Composer, React blocks |
| **imagewize.com** | Site | Enterprise WordPress |

They include full page builds with component extraction, developer handoff notes with WordPress implementation mappings, and project-specific conventions (FSE block compatibility, ACF fields, etc.).

### Rules for the Frontend Agents

1. **Production-ready output only** - No placeholders, descriptions, or "replace with X" comments
2. **Mobile-first** - All output must be responsive by default
3. **No centered overlay heroes** - This is the most common failure pattern to avoid
4. **Realistic content** - Use relevant dummy content, never lorem ipsum or placeholder text
5. **Consistent formatting** - Follow the repository's style guidelines

### Example Agent Runs

The `prompts/` directory contains real agent runs — input prompt, raw output, canvas, and review feedback — so you can see how each agent performs in practice and what to watch out for.

| Run | Agent | Status |
|-----|-------|--------|
| [frontend-dev/elayne-hero-block](/prompts/frontend-dev/elayne-hero-block/) | FRONTEND-DEV | Reviewed — see FEEDBACK.md |
| [reviewer/elayne-hero-block](/prompts/reviewer/elayne-hero-block/) | REVIEWER | FAIL — CSS variable namespace + dash syntax errors |

Each run folder contains:
- **PROMPT.md** — the exact input sent to the agent
- **OUTPUT.md** — raw agent response
- **canvas.html** — generated HTML/CSS output (frontend runs)
- **FEEDBACK.md** — review notes: what worked, what failed, fixes needed

## 🛠 Mistral Vibe Skills

Skills run inside your project with Vibe's tools. They are invoked as slash commands.

| Skill | Command | What it does |
|-------|---------|--------------|
| [code-review](/skills/code-review/SKILL.md) | `/code-review [target]` | Reviews a branch diff, a GitHub PR, or a block, pattern, template or path in place, in any WordPress plugin, theme or site. Detects the project type, minimum PHP/WordPress and lint commands from the repository, and applies the project's own rules from `.agents/code-review.md`. |

```
/code-review                 # this branch against the default base branch
/code-review 51              # GitHub PR #51
/code-review hero            # audit the block or pattern named "hero"
/code-review --help          # usage and valid targets
```

### Install

**Per project** — shared with everyone who works on it: copy `skills/code-review/` to the project's `.agents/skills/code-review/`.

**For all your projects** — add this repository's `skills/` directory to `~/.vibe/config.toml`:

```toml
skill_paths = ["~/code/mistral-agents/skills"]
```

Vibe uses the first skill it finds with a given name, and searches `skill_paths` before a project's `.vibe/skills/` and `.agents/skills/`. If your config sets `enabled_skills`, add `code-review` to it.

### Project rules

The skill's generic checks are the same everywhere; what catches most regressions is the project's own rules. Add them to `.agents/code-review.md` in the project — facts, named audit targets, files to skip, lint commands, and rules with the failure each one prevents. The file format is documented at the end of [SKILL.md](/skills/code-review/SKILL.md). For a plugin or theme, keep `.agents/` and `.vibe/` out of release zips (`.distignore`, `.gitattributes` `export-ignore`).

### Fewer approval prompts

Approvals come from the `[tools.bash] allowlist` in Vibe's config, not from a skill's `allowed-tools`. Put the commands the skill runs in the project's `.vibe/config.toml` so everyone on the project gets the same approvals. A project allowlist **replaces** the one in `~/.vibe/config.toml`, so include the read-only basics too — the **Setup** section of [SKILL.md](/skills/code-review/SKILL.md) has a starting list.

### Project instructions: AGENTS.md, not a system prompt

Vibe loads `AGENTS.md` files on top of its built-in system prompt; that is the place for project rules. `system_prompt_id` in `config.toml` *replaces* the built-in prompt — tool use, planning and editing instructions included — and is rarely what you want. See [Mistral Vibe: AGENTS.md vs a custom system prompt](https://imagewize.com/mistral-vibe-agents-md-vs-custom-system-prompt/).

## 📝 Adding Your Own

### A Le Chat agent

1. **Create**: New `.md` file in the `agents/` directory (e.g., `agents/BACKEND-DEV.md`)
2. **Name it well**: Use role-based naming like `ROLE-SPECIALIZATION.md`
3. **Structure your prompt**:
   - Role description and scope
   - Critical rules (do's and don'ts)
   - Output format expectations
   - Examples of expected output
   - Project-agnostic instructions where possible

**Naming Convention:**
```
{ROLE}-{SPECIALIZATION}.md    e.g., BACKEND-PHP.md
{ROLE}.md                    e.g., DEVOPS.md
{TEAM}-{ROLE}.md             e.g., FRONTEND-DEV.md
```

**Quality Checklist:**
- [ ] Clear, specific instructions (no "you should probably")
- [ ] Examples of expected output
- [ ] Do's and don'ts explicitly stated
- [ ] Project-agnostic where possible (add variants for specific stacks)
- [ ] Follows existing formatting in other prompts

### A Vibe skill

1. **Create** `skills/<name>/SKILL.md` — `name` is lowercase letters, digits and hyphens.
2. **Frontmatter**: `name` and `description` are required; add `user-invocable: true` for a slash command and a `metadata.version` so copies in projects can be compared.
3. **Keep it generic**: project-specific rules belong in the project, not in the skill.
4. **Prescribe allowlist-friendly commands**: plain single commands, no shell loops or one-liners; read files with `read_file`.
